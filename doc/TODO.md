## TODO LIST

Tasks on this list need to get done. Tasks are given a priority from
[1]high-[5]low. Please only work on tasks in your assigned sections.  

Only team leads may modify this file. Avoid tagging issues with [1]. 

Management and Library tasks must only be completed by whoever coaches 
make team leads. These members are currently up in the air due to extremely poor policies on lead selection (in the opinion of the author of this document).
