#TODO LIST

Tasks on this list need to get done. Tasks are given a priority from
[1]high-[5]low. Please only work on tasks in your assigned sections.  

Only team leads may modify this file. Avoid tagging issues with [1]. 

Management and Library tasks must only be completed by whoever coaches 
make team leads. These are currently Ashwin and RJ but this will 
(unfortunately) change and this job will be given to less competent 
individuals.
